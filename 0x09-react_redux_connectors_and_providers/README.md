# 0x09. React Redux Connectors and Providers

This project explores the implementation of **React Redux** concepts in a front-end application, focusing on connectors, providers, and middleware. The primary goal is to manage the application's state efficiently using Redux while improving performance and scalability through techniques such as selectors and memoization. Key tasks include creating reducers, action creators, and connecting components to the Redux store, as well as incorporating async actions with middleware like `redux-thunk`.

## Key Features
- **Redux State Management**: Setup of reducers, actions, and a Redux store to manage UI and data logic for notifications, courses, and user state.
- **Component-Store Interaction**: Use of connectors (`mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`) to bind component props to the Redux store and actions.
- **Middleware Integration**: Implementation of async actions using `redux-thunk` and debugging tools like Redux DevTools for enhanced application performance.
- **Selectors and Optimization**: Development of selectors using `reselect` to improve the performance of complex state computations.

## Getting Started
This project is built using **React** and **Redux** on **Node.js**. It includes test-driven development with Jest and integrates various APIs for notifications and courses. To run the project, clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the development server:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd alx-react/0x09-react_redux_connectors_and_providers
npm install
npm start
